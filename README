Next steps:
1. Confirm step detection works correctly.
    a. play a real two player game with sorted deck
    b. have specific rules to govern the play
    c. record some data over the course of the game (money per round?)
    d. use data to compare against full game test.
2. Fix AIs to check for SupplyErrors when buying
3. Make an AI that will beat BasicAI

POWERGRID:
We suspect that this game is mostly about saving a few dollars here and there,
and that it would be best played by computer.

The goal of this project is to develop an AI that plays powergrid optimally.
