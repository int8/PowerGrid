Next steps:
1. buy enough resources to power as many cities as possible to have at the end of your turn
2. buy cities optimally (buy as many, as soon as possible VS buy expensive first)
3. bid on powerplants intelligently
4. plot test runs
5. better command-line options


POWERGRID:
We suspect that this game is mostly about saving a few dollars here and there,
and that it would be best played by computer.

The goal of this project is to develop an AI that plays powergrid optimally.
