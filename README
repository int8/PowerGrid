Next steps:
1. Confirm step detection works correctly.
    a. use data to compare against full game test.
    b. get the entire test run to pass (monkey patch step 3 pp shuffle)
    c. figure out why step 3 failed if b wasnt at fault
2. Fix AIs to check for SupplyErrors when buying
3. Make an AI that will beat BasicAI

POWERGRID:
We suspect that this game is mostly about saving a few dollars here and there,
and that it would be best played by computer.

The goal of this project is to develop an AI that plays powergrid optimally.
