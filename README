Next steps:
1. Play a new game iteratively. Current test game seems hosed.
    a. use data to compare against full game test.
2. Fix AIs to check for SupplyErrors when buying
3. Make an AI that will beat BasicAI

POWERGRID:
We suspect that this game is mostly about saving a few dollars here and there,
and that it would be best played by computer.

The goal of this project is to develop an AI that plays powergrid optimally.
