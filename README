Next steps:
1. Confirm step 2 works correctly.
2. Fix AIs to check for SupplyErrors when buying
3. Make an AI that will beat BasicAI
4. Make an ai test that runs AIs against each other many times and confirms
    a. no errors occurred.
    b. the best ai always wins

POWERGRID:
We suspect that this game is mostly about saving a few dollars here and there,
and that it would be best played by computer.

The goal of this project is to develop an AI that plays powergrid optimally.
